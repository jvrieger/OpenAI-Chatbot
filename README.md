# OpenAI-Chatbot

Mini-Project: Build a ChatGPT Clone
Overview
In this project, you will create a web application that mimics the functionality of ChatGPT using OpenAI's API. This project will utilize React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. The key task is to handle interactions with OpenAIâ€™s "chat completions" API to maintain a continuous and coherent conversation thread.
